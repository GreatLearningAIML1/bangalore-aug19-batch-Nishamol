R8_Proj8_StatisticalNLP_BlogsAuthorshipCorpus
Used Count Vectorizer, Logistic Regression followed by Multi Label Binarizer 
Used Classification Report, F1Score, Weighted Precision Score and Recall Score
Used Inverse Mulitlabel Binarizer to convert back to original form
Note: Used only 15000 records due to memory constraint
